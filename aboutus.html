 <p>
        There was once five young women who were all very fond of gardening.
        One day, they all met in a gardening event. <br><br>

        At their first encounter, they already felt a big connection.
        After some time getting to know each other, they started to become good friends.
         As years passed by, their friendship became stronger just from their love and passion for Plants and Nature.<br><br>

        One day, they met in a Coffee Shop as usual to spend time with one another. It was just another regular meeting.
        After talking for a while, one of them suddenly said "What if we could make a business out of our hobbies?
        About Plants and Nature? We can sell all the Plants we grow!"
        The other four looked at her with huge excitement written on their faces.<br><br>

        They all worked hard, planting and growing plants, finding employees, and all the sorts.
        And this was how Seedify was formed.

        Plants make us happier, healthier and boost our creativity. They even clean the air we breathe.
        However, the Pandemic arises and no one even dares to get out of their home. So we thought:
        why not bring the outdoors inside? Everyone deserves to have their own plant oasis.
        And we thought that we should make it easier for them to find their new plant.<br><br>

        Plants give so much meaning to a person's life. It is also the reason why this website
        is made. It is made by five plant enthusiasts who wanted to share their love for plants 
        with others.
