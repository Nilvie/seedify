  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="accordion">
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>My order arrived damage, what do i do?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Every plant is fragile and the shipping process is not always kind (or easy). Most of the time we get it right, but sometimes we don’t. When that happens, we fix it – be it a damaged plant or pot due to shipping carrier mishandling. Please inspect your package when you receive your delivery. Should your order arrive damaged, please fill out our contact form (make sure to include a photo) and we’ll get back to you in two business days. The form ensures we have what’s needed to help you as soon as possible! 

In the unlikely event a plant is received dead on arrival, it will always be replaced.</p>

    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>How will my plant arrive?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Our number one priority is that our plants arrive in happy, healthy condition. Some of our plants ship directly potted in our earthenware plants, while others ship in their nursery grow pot placed inside the planter. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Do i have to repot my plant once it arrives?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The short answer is, no. First, let your plant acclimate to its new environment. Place the plant in the spot you plan to keep it in. Let it settle in for about two weeks.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>How does deliver work?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We deliver seven days a week, and your delivery should be with you 6-12 days after placing your order.
<br>

<br>Within Philippines, we deliver between the following hours:
<br>

<br>Monday-Wednesday - 2pm-10pm
<br>Thursday-Sunday - 9am-4pm
<br>
<br>We’ll text and email you the day before your delivery to give you a more precise time slot.
<br>
<br>For deliveries outside Philippines, you’ll receive an email with a link to your order status page once your order is out for delivery.
<br>
<br>If you’re not at home when delivery is attempted, our drivers will usually leave your order in your designated safe place (we’ll ask you for this at check out). If that’s not possible, delivery will be attempted up to two more times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item">
      <a>Do you have No Contact Delivery due to Covid 19 ?</a>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We’re still delivering as normal, but we’re switching to zero-contact delivery until further notice. 
<br>

When your driver delivers your order, they'll the place items at the door, ring the bell using a glove and step back. They will then allow you to the collect your items before retrieving any delivery boxes (if you are in our Philippines delivery area). 
<br>
<br>
If you’d prefer to have your order just left in your safe place, please let us know at checkout.</p>

            Our plants are sourced from veteran farmers to ensure
            the best quality is given to our fellow customers. 
            We gurantee that your ordered plants will arrive 
            safely and happy.
            Our Pots made from ceramic are made by our lovely team.
            There are loads of pots to choose from. Small, Big, Minimal,
            Complex, etc. Not only are our plants high quality, our pots
            and services are too. We include an instruction manual in each
            plant you order. It includes instructions on how often should you
            water your plant, how much sunlight your light needs, how big the
            pot should be if you're planning to transfer it, and the benefits of the 
            plant.
